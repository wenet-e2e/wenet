// DispatchKeySet.  Higher bit indexes get handled by dispatching first (because
// we "count leading zeros" when we extract the highest priority dispatch
// key.)

  // meaningful (e.g., it's valid to reorder these backends without changing
  // semantics).  The only situation when backend ordering is meaningful
  // is when the backend participates in multiple dispatch with another
  // backend; e.g., CPU and SparseCPU (sparse must have
  // higher priority).

  // don't support named tensors.
  //
  // NB: If you ever consider moving named tensor functionality into
  // this dispatch key, note that it might be necessary add another dispatch
  // key that triggers before composite operators, in case a composite operator
  // has named dimension propagation that doesn't match that of its

  Named,

  // See Note [Out-of-tree vmap+grad prototype]. The purpose of this key
  // is to insert code after the "autograd subsystem" runs, so this key should
  // be directly after ADInplaceOrView and all of the autograd keys.
  FuncTorchDynamicLayerBackMode,

  // Note [ADInplaceOrView key]
  // ADInplaceOrView key is used by inplace or view ops to register a kernel
  // that does additional setup for future autograd computation.
  //
  // 1. For inplace ops this kernel does version bump
  // 2. For view ops this kernel does `as_view` setup where we properly setup
  //    DifferentiableViewMeta on the view tensors.
  //
  // For other ops it's fallthrough kernel since there's no extra
  // work to do.
  //
  // Note [Dream: skip VariableType kernel when requires_grad=false]
  //
  // In an ideal world where we can skip VariableType kernel for inputs
  // with requires_grad=false, instead of a fallthrough kernel, we'll
  // register a kernel shown below to all functional ops as well:
  // torch::Tensor my_functional_op(...) {
  //   {
  //     // Note for every op in VariableType, you need to go through
  //     // `AutoDispatchBelowADInplaceOrView` guard exactly once to add the
  //     // key to TLS excluded set. If you don't go through it at all,
  //     // inplace/view ops called through `at::` inside your backend
  //     // kernel will dispatch to ADInplaceOrView kernels and do a lot
  //     // of extra work.
  //     at::AutoDispatchBelowADInplaceOrView guard;
  //     at::redispatch::my_functional_op(...);
  //   }
  // }
  // But this work is currently blocked since it adds an extra dispatch
  // for all ops and it's non-trivial overhead at model level(a few percents).
  // Thus our current approach takes advantage of the fact every kernel go
  // through VariableType kernel first and pulls the
  // `at::AutoDispatchBelowADInplaceOrView` guard of functional ops
  // up to the `VariableType` kernel. Thus we only add the extra dispatch
  // to view/inplace ops to minimize its perf impact to real models.
  ADInplaceOrView,

  // Note [Alias Dispatch Key : Autograd]
  // All backends are oblivious to autograd; autograd is handled as a
  // layer which happens on top of all backends. It inspects the autograd
  // metadata of all inputs, determines what autograd metadata should be
  // constructed by the output, and otherwise defers to the backend to
  // actually do the numeric computation.  Autograd contains
  // the bulk of this logic.

  // Autograd is now an alias dispatch key which by default maps to all
  // backend-specific autograd keys.
  // Backend-specific allow backends to override the default kernel registered
  // to Autograd key as needed.
  // For example, XLA wants to define autograd for einsum directly.
  // Registering a custom autograd implementation at the XLA key won't work
  // because we process Autograd before XLA.  This key has higher priority and
  // gets processed first.  You generally should NOT redispatch after handling
  // autograd here (since that would result in execution of the Autograd
  // operator, which you're trying to skip).  In AutogradXLA implementations,
  // you are responsible for handling autograd yourself, or deferring to other
  // operators which support autograd.

  // Currently we only have backend-specific autograd keys for CPU/CUDA/XLA and
  // reserved user-defined backends. All other in-tree backends share the
  // AutogradOther key. We can add specific autograd key for those backends
  // upon request.

// by end users for experimental or private applications, without needing
// to "standardize" the tensor ID (which would be done by submitting a PR
// to PyTorch to add your type ID).
//
// Private use tensor IDs are appropriate to use if you want to experiment
// with adding a new tensor type (without having to patch PyTorch first) or
// have a private, non-distributed application that needs to make use of a
// new tensor type.  Private use tensor IDs are NOT appropriate to use for
// libraries intended to be distributed to further users: please contact
// the PyTorch developers to get a type ID registered in this case.
//
// We provide two classes of private user tensor id: regular DispatchKeys
// and Autograd DispatchKeys.  DispatchKeys serve the role of ordinary "backend"
// DispatchKeys; if you were adding support for a new type of accelerator, you
// would use a backend DispatchKey, and ideally automatically reuse
// AutogradOther definitions already defined in PyTorch.  AutogradPrivateUse
// DispatchKeys serve as "wrapper" DispatchKeys: they are only necessary for
// tensors that compose multiple internal tensors, and for cases when the
// built-in autograd formulas for operators are not appropriate.

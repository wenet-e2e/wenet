/**
 * The Transform Base Object
 *
 * A Transform is an operation which manipulates a Caffe2 NetDef.
 * You can consider it as a function: Transform.ApplyTo(NetDef) -> NetDef
 *
 * A Transform Operation does 4 things:
 *    1) Creates a Graph object from a NetDef, which stores connections.
 *    2) Pattern Matches on the Graph, to find subgraphs it wants to change.
 *    3) Replaces the subgraphs that it's matched with new operators.
 *    4) Creates a NetDef from the changed Graph, and returns it.
 *
 * The effect of a Transform is defined by its 3 protected virtual functions.
 *    1) PatternRule determines for an ordered subgraph and a node, whether to
 *        consider adding the node to the subgraph.
 *    2) ValidatorRule determines, for an ordered subgraph, whether it is a
 *        match.
 *    3) ReplaceRule mutates the graph, based on a matched subgraph.
 *
 * This is the base class for all derived classes to base off. To create your
 * own transform, write your implementations for PatternRule, ValidatorRule, and
 * ReplaceRule.

   *
   * CONNECTED_SUBGRAPH will only match subgraphs that are connected.
   * These subgraphs satisfy that every node of the match is connected to the
   * subgraph of the nodes that come before it.
   * For example, in the graph (1) --> (2) --> (3) --> (4),
   *    This is capable of matching the subgraph [2, 3] and [4, 3]
   *    This is not capable of matching the subgraph [2, 4].
   *
   *
   * SORTED_WRT_EXECUTION_ORDER will match subgraphs that guarantee
   * sorted execution order.
   * The nodes don't have to be connected. It is faster than General.
   * For example, in the graph (1) --> (2) --> (3) --> (4),
   *    This is capable of matching the subgraph [2, 4], [3, 4].
   *    This is not capable of matching the subgraph [3, 1], [4, 3].
   *
   *
   * GENERAL can match any subgraph.
   * For example, in the graph (1) --> (2) --> (3) --> (4),
   *    This is capable of matching subgraphs [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 2, 1].
   *    There is no ordered subgraph of G that cannot be matched by this.

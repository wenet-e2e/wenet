# This script takes data prepared in a corpus-dependent way
# in data/local/, and converts it into the "canonical" form,
# in various subdirectories of data/, e.g. data/lang, data/lang_test_ug,
# data/train_si284, data/train_si84, etc.

# Don't bother doing train_si84 separately (although we have the file lists
# in data/local/) because it's just the first 7138 utterances in train_si284.
# We'll create train_si84 after doing the feature extraction.

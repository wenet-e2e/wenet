# WeNet Roadmap

This roadmap for WeNet.
WeNet is a community-driven project and we love your feedback and proposals on where we should be heading.

Please open up [issues](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/discussions) on github to write your proposal.
Feel free to volunteer yourself if you are interested in trying out some items(they do not have to be on the list).

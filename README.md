**We** share **Net** together.

## Highlights

* **Production first and production ready**: The core design principle, WeNet provides full stack production solutions for speech recognition.
* **Accurate**: WeNet achieves SOTA results on a lot of public speech datasets.
* **Light weight**: WeNet is easy to install, easy to use, well designed, and well documented.


## Install

### Install python package

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet.git
```

**Command-line usage** (use `-h` for parameters):

``` sh
wenet --language chinese audio.wav
```

**Python programming usage**:

``` python
import wenet

model = wenet.load_model('chinese')
result = model.transcribe('audio.wav')
print(result['text'])
```

Please refer [python usage](docs/python_package.md) for more command line and python programming usage.

### Install for training & deployment

- Clone the repo
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet.git
```

- Install Conda: please see https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Create Conda env:

``` sh
conda create -n wenet python=3.10
conda activate wenet
conda install conda-forge::sox
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install  # for clean and tidy code

# If you encounter sox compatibility issues
RuntimeError: set_buffer_size requires sox extension which is not available.
# ubuntu
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-dev
# centos
sudo yum install sox sox-devel
# conda env
conda install  conda-forge::sox
```

**Build for deployment**

Optionally, if you want to use x86 runtime or language model(LM),
you have to build the runtime as follows. Otherwise, you can just ignore this step.

``` sh
# runtime build requires cmake 3.14 or above
cd runtime/libtorch
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DGRAPH_TOOLS=ON .. && cmake --build .
```

Please see [doc](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/tree/main/runtime) for building
runtime on more platforms and OS.

## Acknowledge

1. We borrowed a lot of code from [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) for transformer based modeling.
2. We borrowed a lot of code from [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/) for WFST based decoding for LM integration.
3. We referred [EESEN](https://github.com/srvk/eesen) for building TLG based graph for LM integration.
4. We referred to [OpenTransformer](https://github.com/ZhengkunTian/OpenTransformer/) for python batch inference of e2e models.
